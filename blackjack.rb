# Write a program where the user can play a game of **Blackjack**. Define and use the following classes to organize your code:
#
# * `Card` to represent an individual playing card. This class should contain the suit and the value and provide methods for determining what type of card it is (e.g. face card or ace).
# * `Deck` to represent a collection of 52 cards. When dealing a hand this class can be used to supply the `Card` objects.
# * `Hand` to represent the player's and dealer's hand. This class will need to determine the best score based on the cards that have been dealt.
